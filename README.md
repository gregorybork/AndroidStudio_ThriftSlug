# README
This Android Studio project creates a safe place where UC Santa Cruz students can buy and sell clothing. 
The app requires a UCSC email for account login and will deny access unless a valid email is provided. <br><br>
There are four main buttons on the main page; Shop (list of seller posting), New Post (submit new item), My Items,
and My Profile. Shop shows the list of seller postings. Each posting can be clicked to view more information about 
size, brand, condition, etc., and if the buyer is interested they can click a button to get seller contact 
information to get further information or meet up on campus for the exchange. New Post has a list of user input, drop
drop down menus, and image uploader to categorize the seller's item. My Item shows a list of all of the seller's postings 
and options to remove a post. My Profile contains all user information; phone number, email, Venmo, etc.

After confirmation, the main page will appear. I wanted to make sure this app only contained UC Santa Cruz student's so buyer
and seller can have confidence in a safe and reliable transacation.
